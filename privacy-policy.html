<h2>Charter on personal data / Privacy policy</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Personal data policy for Senti</h3>
<p>
	<br>Senti is as data controller obliged to protect your personal data, when you as user or guest are
	<br>using Senti Cloud and the services offered by Senti, and aim at you feeling secure about Senti’ handling of
	<br>your personal data. Senti handles personal data about you according to this charter on personal
	<br>data and governing law. Submission of personal data to Senti is shared with WebHouse ApS, the
	<br>data processor.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>1. Senti collects and uses your personal data</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Senti collects information about you in the following instances:</p>
<ol>
	<li>When you sign up for receipt of Senti newsletters</li>
	<li>When you sign up for seminars or similar arranged by Senti</li>
	<li>When you wish to make use of Senti, information about you is collected in order to handle your
		<br>approach to and/or your use of Senti, and in order to offer and supply you with relevant services for
		<br>you</li>
</ol>
<p>Likewise your personal data are used in order to answer specific requests from you. In this
	<br>connection Senti collects only the necessary information about you such as name, address, phone
	<br>number and email address.
	<br>Your personal data are processed and stored only if you voluntarily have informed Senti about
	<br>them for instance by filling in a signing up form for receipt of newsletters, for participating in a
	<br>seminar or similar related to Senti.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>2. Senti passes on your personal data</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In certain cases Senti passes on your personal data, which is processed about you. Your personal
	<br>data can be passed on for instance to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>suppliers Senti cooperates with providing services for you for instance in connection with Senti’
		<br>use of a printer when planning a seminar by production of name tags or similar</li>
	<li>other relevant third parties in connection with your use of Senti; or</li>
	<li>if it is demanded by a conviction or governing law.</li>
</ol>
<p>The passing on of your personal data will only happen to the extent needed and to the necessary
	<br>receivers making it possible to carry out the service you have requested for instance in connection
	<br>with signing up to seminars and arrangements or signing up for newsletters from Senti.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>3. Senti protects your personal data</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Senti has technical and safety precautions to ensure, that your personal data neither accidentally
	<br>nor illegally are erased, made public, lost, depreciated or made open to irrelevant persons,
	<br>misused or in any other way handled contrary to governing law. Senti’ safety procedures and
	<br>processes are revised on an on-going basis in order to ensure reasonable technical and organising
	<br>safety precautions.</p>
<p>
	<br>In practice it is not possible to establish 100 % safety and Senti therefore cannot guarantee that
	<br>your personal data are protected against persons who deliberately attempts to bypassing Senti’
	<br>safety precautions in order to access the data.
	<br>Therefore you are submitting your personal data on your own responsibility.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>You have the right to be informed about which personal data Senti processes about you. If it turns
	<br>out that this information is incorrect or misguiding, you are entitled to make a request to Senti in
	<br>order to have this information corrected, blocked or erased. Moreover you can at any time protest
	<br>against information about you being processed any further.
	<br>You can request that your personal data are erased. In such case Senti cannot supply you with the
	<br>services originally requested.</p>
<p> </p>

	<br>you have asked for, as long as it is necessary for a justified purpose, such as the administration of
	<br>your use of Senti or as long as it is demanded by the law. If we as data controller and data
	<br>processor are obliged to store the data about you from legislative reasons we store the data for as
	<br>long as this legislation is ruling.</p>
<p>
	<br>Your personal data are stored for a maximum of 5 years after the latest use and even longer if
	<br>requested by governing law.</p>
<p> </p>
