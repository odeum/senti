Senti - an open source project that will make Denmark smarter

In collaboration with Geo Fyn A/S, <a href="http://www.webhouse.dk/">WebHouse ApS</a> and <a href="http://www.mapcentia.com/">MapCentia ApS</a> has launched the open source project Senti.

## Purpose of the project

During daily operations, planning and implementation of projects, most municipalities and organisations need to know how their facilities in a broad sense are used (eg. roads, paths, squares, halls, museums, exhibitions and events).

There is a need for knowledge about:

* How many uses the halls and when?
* How many uses the meeting room and when?
* How many visits museums / events and how long are they staying?
* How many people use the new staircase?
* How many people use the passage before / after renovation?
* Where does the traffic congest mostly in the morning?
* Where is it best to place benches and waste containers in the square?

The goal is to develop an open source platform and system that makes it cheap and easy to put gizmos up in the city - The SmartCity. Gizmos (Senti-in-a-Box devices) must be equipped with various "collectors" to count and track the city's users and store data in the cloud and visualize data through maps, graphs and bar charts - a City-Dashboard.

## The pilot count

Initially, we have developed a collector, which is based on registration of passers wifi devices (phones with wifi on). Wifi count is tested in Svendborg and Odense municipalities since the start of 2016, where 9 Senti units have been set up in different parts of the cities. The results are mostly positive: The counts show clear trends in terms of rush hour, weekends, events, etc. Control counts show that about 1/3 of the passing road users will be registered.

All data for the pilot is visualized on maps in the Senti Clous Dashboard at <a href="https://dashboard.senti.cloud/">Senti Cloud Dashboard</a> that collects and stores all the registrations for all Senti-in-a-Box devices.
